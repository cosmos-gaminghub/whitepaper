# <a id="abstract"></a>Abstruct
GAME is an autonomous decentralized game platform that allows game enthusiasts from around the world, such as players, developers, and investors, to directly participate in the operation as one.
Valuable data such as game items will be tokenized on GAME Hub and managed in a decentralized manner. Tokenized items can be stored in the player's wallet and traded at their own will.
In other words, GAME will realize trustless and permissionless item trading by using the blockchain.
In addition, GAME will greatly reduce the barrier to entry for decentralized game development by providing game developers with several modularized and customizable mechanisms.
Community governance will be essential to make these progressive and adaptable systems work.
In order for GAME to continue to be an innovative distributed game platform, it is important that nearly all elements are upgraded sequentially  as necessary.
As an autonomous decentralized platform, community members are encouraged to actively participate in the governance such as by giving an opinion, holding the discussion and voting at the time of modifications and of applications, existing functions and parameters such as marketplaces, staking rewards, and incentives for unique trading platforms as well as the implementation of new functions and applications.
"Build a decentralized autonomous platform and expand the ecosystem through sustainable growth."
The GAME project itself is an epic MMO(Massively Multiplayer Online) RPG.

# <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
## <a id="vision"></a>Our Vision
GAME aims to create an autonomous decentralized game platform that allows game enthusiasts from around the world to directly participate in the operation as one.
In order to be a truly autonomous and decentralized ecosystem, a sophisticated governance system is needed that can reflect the opinions of each community member to the project. GAME realizes that governance system by using Tendermint and Cosmos SDK.
To ensure the sustainable growth of decentralized ecosystems of the next generation, where modification of on-chain parameters and uses of funds deposited in the community pool are determined by governance, optimized governance is essential. To achieve this, community members are required to actively make a suggestion and vote for improvements.
"Support the development of new games so that game enthusiasts can fully enjoy playing games."
We would like to create the ultimate autonomous decentralized game platform that is just irresistible for game enthusiasts.

# <a id="wmgu"></a>What Makes GAME Unique
## <a id="cdados"></a> Community-driven and Decentralized Operation System
In contrast to the traditional centralized organizational structure, where the organization is managed by a chain of command from the top to the bottom, GAME is fundamentally different in that it is an autonomous decentralized organization that develops through the accumulation of  voluntary actions of each independent community member.
As an autonomous and decentralized organization, modification of incentive parameters for staking and liquidity provision as well as commission parameters for the marketplace and trading, the uses of accumulated funds in the community pool and selection of companies for collaboration are determined by the on-chain governance on GAME Hub.
no decision is made by any one absolute administrator, which allows a diverse ecosystem preventing the community from becoming autocratic.

## <a id="hgpbfts"></a> How game players benefit from the system
In conventional games with a centralized structure, the ownership of items acquired through the gameplay and purchases does not belong to the player, but to the game management company. Therefore, players could not buy or sell game items at their own will, and when they quit playing the game, the items they hold become worthless.
For the game companies, not allowing players to keep the value of their items would lead to higher sales in a short time, so it can be said that the system is intentionally built to put players at a disadvantage.
In order for players to maintain the value they have acquired through their efforts in the game even after they quit the game, it is necessary to have a system where the ownership of items acquired in the game belongs to the players and they can freely trade them.
Then GAME will get out of the centralized management of game companies by tokenizing game items on the GAME Hub, and provide a player-friendly system that allows users to manage their own items.
This will allow players to transfer items to acquaintances or sell them through the GAME MarketPlace at their own will. The items sold in this way turn into the key currency of the GAME Hub, $GAME, which can be exchanged for other crypto currencies through DEX in the Cosmos Ecosystem.
 By enabling such a series of free economic activities, players will be able to retain the value of items in the GAME Ecosystem that were previously worthless when they quit Game A and start Game B newly.
Managing game items as digital assets in an evolving game space will lead to a variety of economic activities, and players will be able to enjoy a freer and more attractive decentralized virtual space of the next generation.
No effort in games will be wasted. And the system to be able to earn money from games will be the greatest pleasure for all those who love games.

## <a id="hgdedamtg"></a> How Game Developers Easily Develop and Manage their Games
GAME continues trying to eliminate barriers for each game development and operation, and game developers are supported in four ways in particular.
The first point is the funding for game development and operation.
If small game developers have interesting game ideas, they often do not have the fund to develop them. Conventionally, funding was not easy.  A system that allows such underfunded game developers to show their ideas and easily raise funds from supporters of their ideas can solve the fund problem. GAME will provide a funding platform that will make it easier to raise funds for new game development.　
In this platform, players and investors look at a wide variety of ideas and make investment decisions. This globally and easily funding system will undoubtedly help the game development by using the payment method of crypto currency.　
The second point is the provision of a payment system and publishing platform.
Whenever a game moves to the monetization phase after it's developed and released, a platform for payment system and publishing is required. However, game developers who do not have such platforms themselves have to rely on major platforms and pay large fees.
In general, game developers have to pay from 30% up to 90% fee to platforms depending on the country.　
GAME can drastically reduce these exorbitant payment and publishing fees.
The payment system using blockchain technology realizes a high level of security  without the conventional centralized third party owing to the decentralization. Furthermore, the public chain is open and there is no fee for the introduction of the payment system.
Even though each user must pay a fee to issue transactions to maintain the chain,  there is no fee for game developers to use the payment system.
GAME also offers an overwhelmingly low cost of publishing. The specific percentage of the publishing fee should be determined by the governance of the community members. As an affordable fee to game developers, a few % of the publishing fee seems preferable.
Moreover, such fees from developers were conventionally recorded as profit of the platformers and never returned to the game developers. In the case of GAME, however, fees are returned to the community leading to the prosperity of the GAME ecosystem as a whole and the increase the number of their own game users, which eventually has a positive effect on the developers in the community.
These extremely low fees are a benefit of an autonomous decentralized organization that puts the expansion of the ecosystem first and does not need to pursue short-term profits.
The third point is the provision of various functions and applications for decentralized game development.
If game developers have to create a blockchain from scratch in order to create a blockchain-based game, the barrier to entry is too high and it's unrealistic for the entry.
Therefore, GAME will prepare and provide the necessary functions and applications in advance so that game developers who are not able to create a blockchain from scratch can actually develop decentralized games.
It also lowers the barrier to entry for decentralized game development by providing direct support by engineers in the GAME community in close communication with game development companies.
The final point is the provision of free open assets such as characters and items.
Recovery items such as potions and herbs, weapons such as Excalibur and Gungnir, and characters such as humans, dwarves, elves, and goblins, will be designed in 2D or 3D and issued in advance as FTs or NFTs that can be used across various games in the GAME Ecosystem.
It will be possible to save some costs for the asset design during the game development and conduct pinpoint marketing to specific token holders by allowing all games in the GAME ecosystem to use these assets.
In order to enrich the open assets, we would like to discuss incentives for open asset design in the governance.

# <a id="faa"></a> Function and Application
Specific functions and applications that will be implemented in GAME are introduced.

## <a id="itemtoken"></a> Item Token
Tokenization of game items is one of the most important functions to allow players to manage ownership and trade freely.
There are two main types of tokens that can be generated by game developers on the GAME Hub: Fungible Token and Non-Fungible Token.
The former is a token format used for items such as potions that exist a lot in games, corresponding to ERC-20 tokens in Ethereum. Game items issued as Fungible Token are not different from each other and can be replaced one by one.
However, many games have unique game items with individual value, which make the game space more exciting. Game items with unique level, attack, skill, etc. retain their status as metadata and become Non-Fungible Tokens. This corresponds to the ERC-721 token in Ethereum, which is a unique and irreplaceable token.
Both tokens can be owned by users as digital assets on the GAME Hub, and can be easily traded using the GAME MarketPlace and escrow functions implemented in the game.

## <a id="dex"></a> DEX
Most of the current trades of crypto currencies are conducted through exchanges with an operating entity.
These exchanges are called Centralized Exchanges (CEX) because they use a centralized approach for decision making. In such a CEX, the user's assets are first sent from the user's own wallet to the exchange's wallet, and the balance is managed in the exchange's database. At this time, since the assets themselves are managed by the exchange, users need to trust the exchange, and are completely dependent on the third party (exchange) for their digital assets.
There is a great risk in this situation.
There have been several actual incidents in the past where centralized exchanges have stolen their users' assets or lost customers' assets due to hacking.
In addition, since a CEX has a single point of failure, there is a risk that the server of the exchange, not blockchain, may go down and trading may become impossible due to access concentration or DDoS attacks.
On the other hand, an exchange where transactions are executed in a decentralized manner without an operating entity, as implemented in GAME, is called a Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
Users can manage their own assets at all times, and at the time of trading, users send tokens from their wallets to the transaction address for deposit, allowing them to trade without trusting a third party meaning trustless trading.
As mentioned above, GAME Hub will build a DEX to enable decentralized trading of tokens (Fungible Token) without the need for a third party, creating an environment where players can buy and sell tokens freely.
GAME Hub's DEX will allow players to trade any token on the GAME Hub platform using $GAME as a key currency.
The rate of tokens is determined by the AMM algorithm, which balances the supply and demand. The token with lower supply and higher demand is traded at a higher price.
However, such tokens cannot be traded without liquidity, which makes them impractical, so it is important to design incentives to generate a lot of liquidity.
Decisions such as how much of the $GAME should be distributed to the liquidity providers will be determined by the  governance.

## <a id="marketplace"></a> MarketPlace
In the GAME Marketplace, users can trade and participate in the auction of NFTs available in the GAME ecosystem .
Tokens are traded among players at a price according to their supply and demand. Therefore, it is possible to make a lot of money just by playing the game if you can sell rare items obtained through your gameplay efforts at a high price.
The marketplace is a very important system for sustaining the value obtained through gameplay efforts.

## <a id="tradings"></a> Tradings in Escrow
Items can be smoothly traded with other players in escrow without fraud.
Both players send their tokens to the escrow address, and when both players have deposited their tokens, the token transfer function defined in the module is automatically executed to complete the escrow process.
Trading manner of exchanged Items do not necessarily have to be one item of one type for one item of one type. Escrow tables for all types and quantities of items can be created as predetermined.
Thus, for example, trading such as 1 Item A + 2 Item B + 3 Item C and 1 Item D + 1 Item E can be executed in escrow.
This escrow function to automatically execute on-chain trading without the need to trust a stranger on the other side of the screen can highly enhance the flexibility of the game.
In the GAME Marketplace, users can trade and participate in the auction of NFTs available in the GAME ecosystem .
Tokens are traded among players at a price according to their supply and demand. Therefore, it is possible to make a lot of money just by playing the game if you can sell rare items obtained through your gameplay efforts at a high price.
The marketplace is a very important system for sustaining the value obtained through gameplay efforts.

## <a id="funding"></a> Funding
In the past, many of the games were developed by small and medium-sized game companies as subcontractors and then released by the major game makers.
However, in recent years, it has become easier for individuals to build their own applications, and the situation where you need to belong to a major game maker to develop a game is changing.
The GAME Hub will create a system that allows anyone, including individual game developers and small to medium-sized game companies with limited financial resources, to raise funds for their game projects.
Game developers who raise funds in GAME will submit a white paper or proposal to the community that clearly outlines the concept of their new game and the benefits to investors.
Based on the submitted materials, the community members make a careful examination and have a discussion within the community, and decide whether or not to invest in the project at individual discretion.
The investor sends $GAME to the address provided for the funding and receives a native token. Native token holders will benefit from a variety of predetermined benefits, such as a priority to obtain rare items at the time of the game launches, or automatically receiving X % of game sales in $GAME.
This funding system allows investors to support new games and developers can raise funds to ensure the streamlined development.
Such a system will create a virtuous circle that attracts new games to the GAME ecosystem one after another as well as the new users, leading to the growth of the GAME platform.
In addition, this funding system in GAME can solve the problem that has existed in the past when investing in games.
Conventionally, when investors invested in a game fund, they were only able to receive a few percent of the profits of the fund. At this time, game companies had incentives to increase their expenses to reduce dividends to investors as much as possible, because more dividends did not make a positive contribution to the business management, so they sometimes intentionally kept down the profits. This impropriety caused a gradual decrease in the benefits for investors, which made them reluctant to invest in the game and hindered the development of the game industry.
Furthermore, in the case of investments in games that do not have a well-designed dividend system, it was not uncommon for investors to receive their dividends a few months later, which was a hindrance to investment in the game industry.
However, by using the Funding function, GAME can implement a system that ensures the dividends of the game sales.
Moreover, By using such a trustless reward distribution system, investors no longer need to be worried about a fraud of developers, and can more actively consider game projects as investment targets than ever before.

## <a id="claim"></a> Claim
The Claim module is a module that manages the token distribution for the Claim token holders issued on the GAME hub following their share.
For example, if a portion of game contract sales is transferred to the module account by the Funding function, the Claim token holders can claim their reward according to their share.
GAME will add a function that will allow users to set a GAME ID for each address. This will allow users to specify a familiar ID in the game when sending tokens without having to enter a complicated address.
In addition, users will be able to register and log in to the game with a single signature using the GAME ID linked to the address.
This will reduce the barrier to entry for ordinary game players who are not familiar with crypto currencies, and provide users with a more stress-free gaming experience than ever before.

## <a id="gameid"></a> GAME ID
GAME will add a function that will allow users to set a GAME ID for each address. This will allow users to specify a familiar ID in the game when sending tokens without having to enter a complicated address.
In addition, users will be able to register and log in to the game with a single signature using the GAME ID linked to the address.
This will reduce the barrier to entry for ordinary game players who are not familiar with crypto currencies, and provide users with a more stress-free gaming experience than ever before.

The Explorer allows users to check the details of each address as well as transactions.
In the GAME Hub, which uses a PoS-based consensus algorithm, there are nodes called Validators that generate blocks. In addition, GAME Hub has on-chain governance, a feature that enables the community to make decisions through voting as well as IBC transactions.
The explorer needs to support these functions, and the explorer already available in GAME supports the governance and the IBC module, and allows users to check the voting results and the details of IBC transactions.

## <a id="random"></a> Random number generator module
GAME makes it possible to perform gacha without fraud so that the management side of the game cannot disguise the rate of rare items.
Then the on-chain random number generator becomes important. Generating completely random numbers with a computer is known to be a very difficult challenge. However one approach is to use TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) for secret computation to generate them.
TEE is a special area in a computer which performs like a black box and allows secret calculations. TEE are used in a variety of hardware in everyday use, such as a fingerprint reader in a smartphone.
The Compute module in the Secret Network uses this TEE mechanism to enable on-chain secret computation in the Cosmos ecosystem. Secret nodes in the network can use this secure enclave to protect the data used in secret contracts. GAME aims to use this mechanism to create a Random Number Generator module.
There are other possible innovative privacy solutions including multiparty computing, homomorphic encryption, and private set intersection, but they are not appropriate for operation in current applications. There is always a trade-off between scalability, performance, and security, and we need to continue to explore and research various solutions.

## <a id="platform"></a> Platform
GAME will build a user-friendly game platform where games in the GAME Ecosystem are lined up. At this time, the listing of games on the platform needs to be approved by GAME governance.
In order to collect votes, each game project can make a proposal to pay expenses in $GAME  to the community pool  or share a native token.

# <a id="structure"></a> Structure
Game Hub builds game-specific blockchains using Tendermint, CosmosSDK and CosmWasm.

## <a id="aotendermint"></a> Advantage of Tendermint
There are following advantages when implementing a sovereign blockchain by using Tendermint.
Since the developers can freely implement a standard interface called ABCI, it is possible to implement a sovereign state-machine on the blockchain.
In addition, the developers can freely set the gas, the number of validators, and choose the token model. This is essential for a community-driven blockchain project. Tendermint's consensus algorithm is a PoS in a broader sense, which makes it possible to achieve an overwhelming TPS.
In addition, unlike Ethereum, there is no need to compete for resources with other projects, which is a big advantage. And in Ethereum, bugs cannot be easily fixed due to the various stakeholders involved. On the other hand in a sovereign chain based on Tendermint, bugs can be addressed based on the consent through the governance within the community.
In addition, when the specifications of game items change, they can be easily upgraded using CosmWasm's migrate function as stated below.

## <a id="aocosmossdk"></a> Advantage of CosmosSDK
The CosmosSDK allows you to create the Custom module.
GAME Hub will uniquely customize the NFT module. In addition, using the IBC module in CosmosSDK and the relayer in an off-chain process allow for easy interaction with external Tendermint-based chains.
This allows users to exchange $GAME for other tokens by listing it on multiple DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem, including the DEX implemented on CosmosHub.

## <a id="aocosmwasm"></a> Advantage of CosmWasm
CosmWasm is a plug-in module for Cosmos SDK. It is  designed and built as a multi-chain solution for smart contracts from scratch, and has already been used in a variety of projects. It is an open source project.
From a game developer's perspective, it is tough to build their own chain specific to games from scratch. Therefore, the GAME Hub will provide an environment that enables the execution of generic smart contracts specific to games using CosmWasm.
In addition to using the NFT module on the GAME Hub, game developers can freely implement game logic on the contract side of CosmWasm.

### <a id="amaic"></a> Actor Model adopted in CosmWasm
The Actor Model is a design pattern for building a decentralized system. Each Actor is given authority to manage only its own internal state, and cannot directly rewrite others. If it is necessary to rewrite another state, it sends a message to request the change.
By preventing arbitrary contracts from directly calling other contracts, CosmWasm prevents the exploitation of vulnerabilities of the smart contracts specification called reentrancy attacks, such as the DAO Attack that occurred due to an abuse of the Ethereum smart contract. Inline function calls of malicious code create security vulnerabilities.
The Actor Model approach used in CosmWasm allows arbitrary contracts to return a list of messages executed in the same transaction.
This means that a contract can request to send something that will happen after it finishes, e.g. release of escrow, or call another contract. If a future message fails, the entire transaction, including the update of the contract's state, will be undone.

## <a id="cois"></a> Characteristics of Interoperable Sovereignty
To temporarily solve Ethereum's problems in Appendix A, a number of performance focused platforms at the expense of decentralization in Appendix B have emerged. Platforms with new security models, such as Polkadot in Appendix C have also emerged.
However, when exposed to hacking and other security threats, the reliance on the platform may cause significant damage. Under these circumstances, the concept of "interoperable sovereignty" is essential.
Sovereignty in a narrow sense refers to the independence of an application from the influence of other resources.
If sovereignty is not achieved, for example, if there is a bug in a contract implemented on Binance Smart Chain, there is a possibility that applications referencing the same contract will be attacked in a similar way. Also, if one project explodes in popularity, other projects will face problems such as high gas prices and slow transaction processing speed.
Sovereignty is an important factor when it comes to the security and scalability of such applications.
It is expected that various blockchain projects will be created in the next decade and will literally constitute the "Internet Of Blockchains". New chains and tokens will be created and then disappear, grow and then scaled back, split and then merged. In this dynamism, each chain or token forms its own community.
The streak of interactions of each community is also essential. Communications between each community having an individual role through IBCs will create a loosely coupled connection with no single point of failure.
Application-specific blockchains using Cosmos SDK do not have to worry about the conventional blockchain problems mentioned above, and they can communicate with each chain due to IBC to send and receive tokens.

# <a id="conclusion"></a> Conclusion
Blockchain is a technology that allows P2P (Peer to Peer) approval of transactions without the need for a centralized third party. Although it has developed centered around Bitcoin, it is attracting attention in various fields as a new technology that is tamper proof, highly available, and can significantly reduce operational costs.
In addition to remittance and settlement, other applications  are also being attempted and empirical research is currently underway in various fields. However, all of these examples are far from being put to practical use, and are still in their infancy.
In 2017, a variety of blockchain projects were launched and ICOs were actively conducted to raise funds. However, there were some fraudulent projects that raised large amounts of funds through ICOs by forcibly associating themselves with blockchain even though they did not need to use it.
The core value of blockchain is that it is "trustless" and "permissionless", but a project that ignores this is not different from an existing system at all, and cannot be what brings about a revolution that will create the next generation.
Not to mention an insight into the true nature of the significance of blockchain, it is no exaggeration to say that the fate of a blockchain project depends on the community that supports the project, the utility value of the token, and the product itself. The community is essentially a bottom-up ecosystem with the belief that it is open source and non-profit, and is completely different from the existing top-down business ecosystem.
The token represents the ownership of value, and while it is just electronic data, it has an important role to play in creating a new economic sphere in the virtual world. The product is the fruits of technology using blockchain. Without the existence of a community and the high utility value of tokens, even if only a product is created, it is not enough to make a blockchain project attractive.
In a current situation where use cases of blockchain are scarce, it is a well-established project as a practical use case that will determine the future of the many blockchain projects.
While blockchain technology is attempted to be driven into a practical use , GAME Hub as a blockchain project, will build a blockchain and associated extended applications based on practical value in order to establish itself as a use case regarding games.  To achieve this, GAME Hub will focus on the implementation of game item tokens to assure the item ownership of users, DEX in GAME Hub to facilitate trade between users, a funding system and SDK for game developers.
The GAME Hub will create a decentralized game platform that will change the way games are played and realize a token economy in the virtual world by the community-driven operation and by treating $GAME as a key currency within the GAME Hub to add value to the token.
On the other hand, the GAME Hub also plays a role in presenting a new way of gaming to society. No matter what kind of game people play, they will soon get bored. It's because they have lost sight of what lies beyond the game. It might be because we are dominated by the belief that games are just a part of entertainment, something empty and unrelated to the real world.
However, along with the development of esports, the traditional way of playing games is being reconsidered around the world. In addition, the use of blockchain technology, although still in its infancy, is making it possible to store digital data in a decentralized manner while maintaining unfalsifiability and high availability.
The era when no matter how well players play in a game, they are not evaluated at all in the real world is coming to an end, and a new era is just around the corner when the game play will bring excitement, envy, and superiority to others in the real world.
Following that historical background, GAME Hub, as a decentralized game platform, will create an "overwhelmingly free and realistic" virtual space which players can truly absorbed in by providing a new sense of game value from the player's perspective as well as clarifying the purpose of playing games in a new way, which may vary from player to player, such as excitement, admiration, and superiority.
We believe that it is we, the younger generation, who will create a new era.
To bring the best entertainment to all game enthusiasts.

# <a id="appendices"></a> Appendices
## <a id="appendix-a"></a> Appendix A: Challenges of Ethereum
Since the Ethereum network is a platform that enables the implementation of various decentralized applications, all projects are all developed on only one blockchain, Ethereum. As a result, the Ethereum network is forced to process a large number of transactions.

As of November 2021, there were approximately 170,000 unconfirmed transactions occurring on a regular basis, and transaction fees skyrocketed. This is due to the emergence of new applications such as DeFi and the resurgence of the NFT bubble.

In terms of TPS (Transaction per Second), while better than Bitcoin, Ethereum's figure of 15 transactions per second is clearly inadequate for a network expected to grow in the future. In the gaming industry, instant payments are required and  this problem will lead to a significant reduction in UX. There have been discussions of improvements using off-chain technologies, but the date and feasibility of implementation are still unclear.

In addition, it should be noted that the system was rolled back to deal with the DAO Attack and the hard fork as a result caused a partial division in the community. The use of Ethereum involves problems and risks due to the intervention of various projects caused by Ethereum's structure. To realize the free virtual space that the Game Hub aims for,  a new framework with a high user experience specific to games is needed.

## <a id="appendix-b"></a> Appendix B: Appearance of New Platforms Imitating Ethereum
Binance Smart Chain (BSC), launched by Binance, the world's leading exchange, is a forked version of Go Ethereum, one of the implementations of Ethereum protocol. DPoS, not traditional PoW, is used as its consensus algorithm with 21 validators. BSC is actually a private chain that has succeeded in handling a large number of transactions by greatly reducing the cost of consensus compared to Ethereum, and has become a major platform used by various projects including Pancakeswap.

Similarly, Polygon and Solana have emerged as easy to use chains that can handle large volumes of transactions. It is no exaggeration to say that we are currently in a situation of flood of platforms.

## <a id="appendix-c"></a> Difference between Cosmos and Polkadot
Cosmos and Polkadot have in common that they both make it easy to create blockchains with interoperability. However they have significant differences in their security model.

In Polkadot, there is a parent chain called Relay Chain and a child chain called parachain. The Relay Chain manages the global state of each connected parachains using a consensus algorithm called GRANDPA that is used for the block finality. Polkadot uses a "shared security" model, making the security of the Relay Chain available to parachains. On the other hand, in Cosmos Network, each chain is independent and the security of its own chain is guaranteed by a validator set for each chain.

In the case of Polkadot, the number of parachains that can connect to Relay Chain is currently set to 100, and each parachain will connect through a mechanism called parachain auction. However, Cosmos Network allows anyone to freely build their own chain connected to each other.
